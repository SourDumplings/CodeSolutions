-- Exercise 5.4: We can represent a polynomial a_n*x^n +
-- a_{n-1}*x^{n-1} + ... + a_1*x^1 + a_0 in Lua as a list of its
-- coefficients, such as {a_0 , a_1 , ..., a_n}.  Write a function
-- that takes a polynomial (represented as a table) and a value for x
-- and returns the polynomial value.
function polyval(p, x)
    local sum = 0
    for i, a in ipairs(p) do
        sum = sum + a * x ^ (i - 1)
    end
    return sum
end
